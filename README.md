# My-Data-Science-Personal-Projects-R-Python-
This repository contains project codes and details of the assignments , I undertook to develop my data science skills in R and Python. Helpful for recruiters to assess my skills before interviewing and knowing me in person.
The first assignment showcased is Data Exploration and Data Visualization done in R on World Happiness Data taken from Kaggle. To summarise my activities, it is worth mentioning that the report contains some world heat maps showing the World Happiness Score of countries. I also made the correlation plots to know the inter relation between the 7 factors contributing to the World Happiness Score of a country.
Happy Exploring the World Happiness Report.
I have included the HTML version of my report that was produced using R Markdown.
